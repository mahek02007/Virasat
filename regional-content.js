Formed on May 1, 1960, it carries the legacy of the great Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, a rich tradition of saint-poets like Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram, and five UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Its culture is a dynamic synthesis of ancient cave art, vibrant festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, martial traditions, and the Bhakti movement's egalitarian philosophy.",

The <strong>Vakatakas</strong> followed, commissioning the later caves at Ajanta. The <strong>Rashtrakutas</strong> and <strong>Chalukyas</strong> carved Ellora's masterpieces, while the <strong>Yadavas of Devagiri</strong> oversaw the golden age of Marathi language.",

The Peshwas later expanded Maratha influence \"from Attock to Cuttack.\" After British annexation in 1818, Maharashtra became the epicenter of social reform — led by Mahatma Phule, Savitribai Phule, and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar — and the freedom struggle."

During 16th–18th century invasions, servitors covertly sheltered the deities in remote Chilika islands and Marada ('Chhada Deula'). The Marathas (1751–1803) established endowments and regularized the Jagannath Sadak pilgrim route, leading to British administration and the statutory <strong>Shri Jagannath Temple Act of 1955</strong>."
