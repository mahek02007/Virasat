        "lavani": "Lavani is Maharashtra's high-energy traditional dance set to the 14-beat Dhadya rhythm of the Dholki. It has two forms: Nirguni (philosophical) and Shringari (celebratory), traditionally performed in Nauvari (9-yard) sarees.",
        "default": "Namaskar! I'm Shrishti, your cultural guide for Maharashtra. Ask me about Maratha hill forts, Ajanta-Ellora caves, Warli painting, the Pandharpur Wari pilgrimage, or delicious Maharashtrian cuisine!",

        "dance": "Odissi is one of India's eight classical dances, characterised by Tribhangi (three-bend posture) and Chauka. It evolved from ancient temple Maharis and Gotipua boys' acrobatics, revived globally in the 1950s by Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra.",

        "default": "Jai Jagannath! I'm Shrishti, your cultural guide for Odisha. Ask me about the 12th-century Jagannath Temple, Rath Yatra chariots, Pattachitra paintings, sacred Mahaprasad, or classical Odissi!",
